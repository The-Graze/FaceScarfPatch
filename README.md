# FaceScarfPatch
FaceScarfPatch is a mod for Gorilla Tag which fixes arguably the most broken cosmetic, the Face Scarf.

## What the mod fixes
This mod fixes two broken factors about the Face Scarf cosmetic
- The mod fixes the Chest Piece being overwritten which later on results in the piece not appearing
- The mod hides a duplicate Face Scarf which can both block your vision in certain scenarios and make the cosmetic look bad
